In this project, I was able to play around with HTML and CSS and get comfortable using Github and deploying my website on Render. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
I was able to add rules for p, li, h1 (cursive website header), h2 (header before lists). I played with the fonts, font sizes, line heights, colors. I also got to experiment with classes which was really cool and helpful. I added a hover feature in which a pink shadow highlights an element, and it animates in slowly.

## Design Achievements
- **Color Palette** I knew I wanted to use blue, green, yellow, and pink, so I picked images based off of this and referenced a color palette for the rest of the fonts.
- **Google Font** I used the cursive Windsong for my header, and Ubuntu Mono for the rest of my text.
