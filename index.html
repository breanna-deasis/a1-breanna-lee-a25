        <!--When I was younger I loved making games on scratch and websites on neocities, so doing this again
        is really exciting. I find a lot of joy going back to the Philippines where streets are flooded
        with excessively colorful flyers, and browsing websites on neocities - an unpretentious website hosting service 
        that continues to teach young queer kids how to make websites. My inspiration and design is heavily
        motivated by a desire to express myself and feel connected to my culture. In high school, I found a safe and supportive community through 
        the internet, which led me to to administrating a meme page to advocate for and share stories between students and employees, 
        encourage people to join our hiking club, share resources for trans people and those struggling with addiction, and create 
        a makeshift take-one-leave-one bookshelf!! I'm not on the internet as much anymore, because I have a job and started going to the gym, 
        but I am so excited to learn and create more :D -->

        Hiiii, welcome to my website! I am in the class of 2027 studying <b> Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity.</b> In my free time 
        I find myself researching medicine, cooking with and for the people I love (everyone), making clothes and jewelry, playing board games,
        and weightlifting. I've been reading more sci-fi and love Octavia Butler so if you have any recs, please let me know!
